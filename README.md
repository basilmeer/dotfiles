# dotfiles

Not the most clean configs but they work for me

- tmux
- nvim
- alacritty
- zshrc

## Getting Started

Reminder to setup some stuff before pasting the confs

### [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)

- Because I'm using a omz plugin for it

### [oh-my-posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh)

- Need to install `CascadiaCode` for alacritty
- Copy over the [patriksvensson](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh) theme

### [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)

- Need to clone
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```
